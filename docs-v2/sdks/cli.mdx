### Install the Nango CLI

Install the Nango CLI globally: 
```bash
npm install nango -g
```

In the folder where you want your integration folder (e.g. root of your project), run:
```bash
nango init # Creates `./nango-integrations` with initial config
```

### CLI Authentication

Add the following env vars. We recommend that you have a `.env` file in `./nango-integrations`:
```bash
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_PROD='<prod-secret-key>'
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_DEV='<dev-secret-key>'
```

Get your `prod` and `dev` secret keys from the [Project Settings tab](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings) (toggle between the `prod` and `dev` environment in the left nav bar).

<Info>
For self-hosting, set the `NANGO_HOSTPORT` env variable to `http://localhost:3003` (for local development) or your instance's URL.

## Command Details

### `init`
The `init` command is the first optional command you run when setting up Nango. It creates a `nango-integrations` directory and adds files for the example Github integration. However, it does not create a `dist/*` folder. It should be used to initialize Nango.

### `dev`
The `dev` command is the fundamental and mandatory command for developing on Nango. It watches over `nango.yaml` to generate the `models.ts` file (both model interfaces + sync helper classes) and watches over sync scripts to build the `dist/*` folder. It should not generate nor edit sync script .ts files. It should be used during the development process.

### `generate`
The `generate` command is an optional helper command that generates initial scaffolds for sync scripts (once). To do so, it also needs to (redundantly with `dev`) generate the `models.ts` file. It should be used to generate initial scaffolds for sync scripts and the `models.ts` file.
