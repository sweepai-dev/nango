## Writing integrations with Nango?

When you write integrations with Nango, 95% of it is already built for you. Nango provides all the hard infrastructure that is common across integrations ([list of features](/introduction#nango-at-a-glance)).

You just have to write the remaining 5% of code that is specific to your integration:

-   Which data would you like to sync? 
-   How should it be transformed? What is the resulting data model?
-   Which data would you like to write back and when?

Based on this, Nango generates a fully-typed SDK and runs your integrations reliably in production.

## Architecture

### API Authorization

Your users authorize integrations inside your app, with an OAuth popup. All it takes is a call to the [frontend SDK](/sdks/frontend). 

Nango takes care of obtaining, storing and refreshing API credentials. 

You can then retrieve API access tokens, always fresh, with the [backend SDKs](sdks) or [API](api-reference).

### Continuous _syncs_

Nango lets you define how data is synced with external APIs, e.g. fetch Salesforce contacts, GitHub issues, Slack messages, Google Calendar events etc.
_Syncs_ are defined by you and live in your own repository: They are version-controlled with the rest of your codebase.

We have [examples](/examples) for many popular use cases to help you get started and we have tooling to help you write and test _syncs_ locally (see the [guide on writing syncs](guides/sync)).

When your _syncs_ are ready, you deploy them with a CLI command to Nango: Nango then runs them for you in production and handles scaling, scheduling, retries, data caching, de-duplication etc.

### Proxy Requests

Sometimes you want to make one-off API requests, e.g.
- Write data back on demand
- Fetch data that doesn't need to be continuously synced (e.g. for onboarding)

The Proxy makes this easy and lets you benefit from authorization, retries, rate-limit handling, monitoring, etc.

Take a look at the [Proxy guide](/guides/proxy) for examples & more details.

### Webhooks

Nango supports two kinds of webhooks:
- External webhooks: from the external API to Nango, to notify of data changes in real-time
- Nango webhooks: from Nango to your app, to notify your app that new data is available (on sync job completion or external webhook reception)

## Dashboard: Monitoring & management of _syncs_

The [Nango Dashboard](https://app.nango.dev) shows you a detailed activity log of every sync and proxy request.  
You can view detailed logs of every sync run and also log your own messages from _sync_ scripts.

![Activity overview of syncs](/images/nango-sync/nango-sync-activity.png)

You can also see and manage the _syncs_ for each [connection](/core-concepts#connections) (integration setup by a user).

## Glossary

Terms we frequently use:

### API configurations[](#api-configurations)

An _API configuration_ (e.g. the `hubspot` configuration) contains the configuration in Nango that is specific to an external API. In particular:

-   Auth-related configuration (auth type, OAuth URLs, auth quirks, etc.)
-   Sync-related configuration (rate-limits, pagination strategy, etc.)

These configuration are contributed and regularly improved by Nango and its community. Configurations allow to rapidly adapt Nango to work with any API, by editing a `.yaml` configuration file.

You can find more information and contribute _API configurations_ [here](/contribute).

### Integrations[](#integrations)

Developers create _integrations_, based on [API configurations](/core-concepts#api-configurations), to work with external APIs from their app.

Integrations are created by you in the Nango Dashboard. You then control how they work with syncs and our SDKs or REST APIs.

### Connections[](#connections)

When a user of your app authorizes an [integration](/core-concepts#integrations), Nango calls this a new _connection_: E.g. `user1` authorizes a `Github` _integration_ to sync issues in your app.

Connections represent the relation between an end user and an external API. It contains the necessary credentials to access the external API on behalf of the user together with metadata and per-user configuration.

### Syncs[](#syncs)
_Syncs_ are responsible to continuously synchronize data between an external API and Nango. Each _sync_ has: 
- an entry in the `nango.yaml` configuration file in the `nango-integrations` folder
- a _sync_ file (typescript script) in the `nango-integrations` folder
_Syncs_ have 'runs' or 'jobs' that are executed periodically. They can be managed (stopped, paused, resync, etc.) from the Dashboard or your code (with the SDK/REST API).

### Nango Infrastructure[](#nango-infrastructure)

Nango's infrastructure consists of the following components, that we see companies re-build over and over again:

-   (O)Auth server
-   Orchestrator to schedule sync jobs (Temporal)
-   Background workers & ETL-like pipelines to sync data with external APIs
-   Postgres database to store auth/sync-related configuration + cached data
-   Tooling to write & deploy developer-supplied integration code
-   SDKs, REST API & webhooks to access the data sync from external APIs
-   Admin console to manage & observe integrations
-   REST API to manage integrations programmatically

## CLI Commands

### `init`
The `init` command is the first optional command you run when setting up Nango. It sets up the Nango environment for your project. For more details, refer to the [CLI documentation](/sdks/cli).

### `dev`
The `dev` command is the fundamental command for developing on Nango. It watches over your project files and builds the necessary output for Nango to run. For more details, refer to the [CLI documentation](/sdks/cli).

### `generate`
The `generate` command is an optional helper command that generates initial scaffolds for sync scripts. For more details, refer to the [CLI documentation](/sdks/cli).
